<!-- Stage 1: 
webpage is an artsy background with some kind of simple logic puzzle 

once logic puzzle is solved, go to stage 2

stage 2: 
text based game style resume  -->

<!-- some random notes
-would love to have some ascii-esque artwork in here to simulate rooms and things
-transition to decrease width of the div with text and then transition to slide game based ui
up in the empty space (game inventory, documents, etc)
-lock puzzle? would seemingly be pretty easy but I just need to find free assets instead 
of making it on my own-->
