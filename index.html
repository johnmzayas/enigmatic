        <h3>The Enigmatic Manor</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to "The Enigmatic Manor," a mysterious text-based adventure game. You find yourself standing at the front gate of an old and eerie manor, hidden deep within the foggy woods. 
            The manor once belonged to a renowned eccentric scientist, Dr. Archibald Sinclair, who vanished under mysterious circumstances. Rumor has it that his spirit still haunts the estate, 
            guarding a hidden treasure.
        </p>

        <p>Objective: Unravel the secrets of the manor, solve puzzles, and find the hidden treasure while avoiding the traps set by the late Dr. Sinclair.</p>

        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
        <p>
            Type commands using simple text, such as "go north," "examine painting," or "take key."
            Explore different rooms and areas by navigating with directions like north, south, east, and west.
            Investigate objects, gather clues, and piece together the mystery of the enigmatic manor.
        </p>

        <p>Let the adventure begin!</p>

    <div class="hide">
        <p>
            You stand at the entrance of the manor, surrounded by an eerie silence. The 
            imposing wooden door creaks open, inviting you inside. Dusty chandeliers dimly 
            light the grand foyer. As you step forward, the door slams shut behind you, and 
            you realize there's no turning back.
        </p>

        <h5>Go north</h5>
        <p>
            You find yourself in a dimly lit hallway. Doors line the walls on both sides. There 
            are mysterious symbols etched onto the walls. A painting hangs on the far end of the 
            corridor.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Examine symbols</h5>
        <p>
            The symbols appear to be some ancient script, possibly a clue to unravel the mysteries 
            of this place.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Go east</h5>
        <p>
            You enter a dark study. Cobwebs hang from the bookshelves, and a large desk sits in 
            the center. There's an open journal on the desk.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Read journal</h5>
        <p>
            The journal contains cryptic notes and drawings, hinting at hidden passages within the 
            manor.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Go west</h5>
        <p>
            You discover a dusty laboratory filled with strange contraptions and alchemical 
            equipment. There's a locked cabinet in the corner.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Examine cabinet</h5>
        <p>You notice a keyhole, and it seems you need a specific key to unlock it.</p>
    
        <h5>Go south</h5>
        <p>
            You find yourself in a grand dining hall. A long table is set with dusty plates and 
            empty glasses. At the end of the hall, there's a shimmering object under a glass case.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Examine object</h5>
        <p>You see a sparkling gem, possibly the rumored treasure.</p>
    
        <h5>Take gem</h5>
        <p>As you try to lift the gem, an alarm bell rings, and the room begins to tremble. The 
            floor opens beneath you, revealing a dark pit.</p>
    
        <h5>Jump north</h5>
        <p>
            You manage to leap to safety, back in the hallway. The alarm stops, but the door 
            to the dining hall is now locked.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Go east</h5>
        <p>You return to the study.</p>

        <h5>Use key on cabinet</h5>
        <p>
            You use the key found in the journal to unlock the cabinet. Inside, you find a 
            map revealing hidden passages.
        </p>

        <h5>Go west</h5>
        <p>You return to the laboratory.</p>
    
        <h5>Examine contraptions</h5>
        <p>You notice one of the contraptions has a hidden lever.</p>
    
        <h5>Pull lever</h5>
        <p>The laboratory wall opens, revealing a secret passage.</p>
    
        <h5>Go north</h5>
        <p>
            You follow the secret passage, leading you to Dr. Sinclair's private quarters. 
            There, you find a safe.
        </p>
    
        <h5>Unlock safe</h5>
        <p>
            Using your wits, you manage to unlock the safe's combination. Inside, you find the 
            long-lost treasure!
        </p>

        <p>
            Congratulations! You have successfully solved the mystery of "The Enigmatic Manor" 
            and claimed the hidden treasure.
